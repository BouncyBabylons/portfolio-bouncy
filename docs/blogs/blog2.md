# Blog 2

*Disclaimer: This is my critical take of Rhea's lovely thoughts. I may very well agree with many of her points. At times, I may be playing devil's advocate in order to stir the pot. I will let the discerning reader decide what is what.*


## My critique of Rhea's [post](https://bhattacharjee-rhea.github.io/portfolio-rheab/blogs/lecture16.html):

You've got a lot of gall, Rhea. 

It speaks volumes that you're so willing to carry water for Volkswagen. I wonder how much they're paying you to spread propaganda like that New York Times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/business/volkswagen-emissions-regulations-reform.html). You know who else was willing to carry water for Volkswagen?

Allegiances aside, I would like to have been a fly on the wall of the Volkswagen organization during this Dieselgate period. After reading the UVA [article](https://ideas.darden.virginia.edu/vw-emissions-and-the-3-factors-that-drive-ethical-breakdown) that you've linked I don't believe the decision to cheat emissions tests came from the top. A handful of engineers would have been capable of duping the entire organization. Lynch mentions the fear that pervaded Volkswagen's autocratic corporate structure -- a win at all costs mentality. In addition, the siloed organization of a company that operates at such a large scale can give the illusion of cover.

My feeling is that these types of problems arise because of the size and momentum that organizations have. Lynch's article says that Volkswagen has a 25-page Code of Conduct. Such a bureaucratic tome is easily ignored when you're in a corporation that employs hundreds of thousands of people. Safety in numbers can diminish one's vigilance. Think about hot tubs. It probably wouldn't cross your mind to pee in a hot tub if it were just you and another person inside. A hot tub with a thousand people in it? You can guarantee that it's filled to the brim with urine. May we treat companies with the same skepticism with which we treat hot tubs.
