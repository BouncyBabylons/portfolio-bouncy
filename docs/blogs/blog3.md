# Blog 3

*Disclaimer: This is my critical take of Emily's lovely thoughts. I may very well agree with many of her points. At times, I may be playing devil's advocate in order to stir the pot. I will let the discerning reader decide what is what.*


## My critique of Emily's [post](https://emilymchen.github.io/portfolio-emilychen/blogs/blog3.html):

The paradox I encounter is realizing that traffic is pretty easily-solved by smart people who do traffic engineering. *I don't want traffic to go away*. It's a reminder that we're all in this together. It's a reminder that we're imperfect humans.

Can you picture a world where nobody is bothered by these things? I often think about 

We've rapidly outgrown the small communal tribes that form our basis.
