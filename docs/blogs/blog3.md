# Blog 3

*Disclaimer: This is my critical take of Jennet's lovely thoughts. I may very well agree with many of her points. At times, I may be playing devil's advocate in order to stir the pot. I will let the discerning reader decide what is what.*


## My critique of Jennet's [post](https://jennet-zamanova.github.io/portfolio-6104/blogs/guest2.html):

Jennet, I intended to approach your blog post with a level head. However, by the time I reached your first paragraph my blood was boiling.

**NEWSFLASH**: there may be even more loopholes in your blog's choice of heading than in "current systems".
