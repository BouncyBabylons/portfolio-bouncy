# Blog 1

*Disclaimer: This is my critical take of Heather's lovely thoughts. I may very well agree with many of her points. At times, I may be playing devil's advocate in order to stir the pot. I will let the discerning reader decide what is what.*

## My critique of Heather's [post](https://heather-parkk.github.io/portfolio-hpark/blogs/blog5.html):

First of all, how dare you? Prepare to be eviscerated, Heather. 

I followed your [link](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/) to B Corp search, because I wanted to get a feel for the current B Corp landscape. The results were unsettling. 

I did a search for companies that want to [blow up the planet](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/?query=companies%20that%20want%20to%20blow%20up%20the%20planet&sortBy=companies-production-en-us). Apparently, a full 26 percent have such a mission built-in to their corporate ethos. Furthermore, 12 percent [support genocide](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/?query=companies%20that%20support%20genocide&sortBy=companies-production-en-us). High standards? More like, high risk of sending our society to the depths. B Corp? More like, B Careful Who You Work For. My preconception of how perusing this catalogue would go is that it would be a "who's who" of corporate America. Instead, my question was always: *Who the hell is that?* Seems like "B Team" would be a more apt descriptor.


I also read the Forbes [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissawheeler/2024/04/18/leading-with-purpose-csr-esg-b-corps-and-social-enterprise/) that you linked because I wanted to learn more about what constitutes a B Corp. Multiple spelling errors aside, the article really only mentioned that the defining factor of a B Corp is that it's been certified as such by this mysterious "B Lab". So I dug in to B Lab's [standards](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/standards/), which you also graciously linked. Nowhere in B Lab's standards did I find any mention of the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). Checkmate. 


The Harvard Business Review [article](https://hbr.org/2016/06/why-companies-are-becoming-b-corporations) that you shared seemed even-handed in analyzing the B Corps trend. It occurred to me that it's nearly impossible to do a qualitative analysis on an individual's ethics and motivations. By extension, it's even more difficult to make such an analysis on a collection of individuals (e.g. a corporation). I'm really having a difficult time seeing how B Corps differ from any other organization. Does Ben & Jerry's have the moral high ground compared to Goldman Sachs? Just because they promise so in their corporate charter?

Instead, could it be that it's just slogans, virtue signaling, and lip service that has become a profitable alternative to raising capital? Call me a cynic. I really want to be wrong. This solution seems arbitrary and subjective, and it seems like it doesn't resolve root systemic issues. Based on Lyel's lecture it sounds like there is a different legal standard that these B Corps are held to. B Corps want to survive just as badly as A Corps do. If faced with a lawsuit, B Corps will do what any self-interested organization would do. They'd hire very good lawyers. And you don't pay lawyers with empathy and good will. You pay them with cash. Capitalism seems like an unavoidable obstacle to this zero-sum game we play.


Thank you for the TV show recommendation and for the corresponding ethics [blog](https://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2019/11/the-good-place-the-bad-place-and-the-ugly-consequences/). I do love a good metaphysical ponderance, even though the ethics blog had my tiny brain contorting in knots. A further spoiler == *we are in the bad place at this very moment.* Do the math.


In conclusion, I thought your arguments were prudent and that your writing was eloquent. It's too bad that we're required to critique each other, because all I really wanted to do was heap praise on your compelling think piece. Also, in your final bullet point you've got a typo.
